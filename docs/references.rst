Historical Notes
---------------

The field of theoretical computer science emerged from the work of mathematicians 
and logicians in the early 20th century, including:

* **Kurt GÃ¶del**: Incompleteness theorems
* **Alonzo Church**: Lambda calculus
* **Alan Turing**: Turing machines and computability
* **John von Neumann**: Stored program concept

These foundational contributions continue to influence modern computer science 
and software engineering practices.
