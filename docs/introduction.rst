Introduction
============

Theory of computation is the branch of computer science and mathematics that deals with 
how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using algorithms. 
The field is divided into three major branches:

Automata Theory and Formal Languages
------------------------------------

This area focuses on mathematical models of computation and the languages they can recognize.

Key concepts include:

* Finite automata
* Context-free grammars
* Regular expressions
* Turing machines

Computability Theory
-------------------

Also known as recursion theory, this branch deals with which problems can be solved 
algorithmically.

Core topics:

* Decidable and undecidable problems
* The halting problem
* Reduction techniques
* Recursive and recursively enumerable sets

Computational Complexity Theory
-------------------------------

This field analyzes the computational resources required to solve computational problems.

Main areas:

* Time complexity
* Space complexity
* Complexity classes (P, NP, PSPACE, etc.)
* Approximation algorithms

Purpose of This Documentation
----------------------------

This documentation aims to provide practical guidance for students, researchers, and 
practitioners working with theoretical computer science concepts. We focus on:

* Clear explanations of complex concepts
* Best practices for implementation
* Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
* Real-world applications and examples
